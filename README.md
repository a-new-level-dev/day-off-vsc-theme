# Day Off VSCode Theme

[GitLab Source](https://gitlab.com/anewlevelmedia/day-off-vsc-theme)

[Visual Studio Marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ANewLevelMedia.day-off-color-theme)

This is a remix of the popular Brogrammer theme that I first discovered and used in Sublime Text 3.

Hope you enjoy!!!

_P.S. This theme is created with the use of the "Operator Mono" font in mind. (ligatures are optional)_

## Note

The colors you see in the indents are the result of another extension: [Indent Rainbow](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=oderwat.indent-rainbow).
