# Day Off Color Theme

This is a color theme extension for the VS Code editor.

It is a remix of the popular Brogrammer theme first discovered and used in Sublime Text 3.

Hope you enjoy!!!

## Note

This theme is created with the use of the "Operator Mono" font in mind (ligatures are optional).

The colors you see in the indents are the result of another extension: [Indent Rainbow](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=oderwat.indent-rainbow).
