This is a remix of the popular Brogrammer theme that was first discovered and used in Sublime Text 3.

Hope you enjoy!

_P.S. This theme is created with the use of the "Operator Mono" font in mind._

## Note

The colors you see in the indents are the result of another extension: [Indent Rainbow](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=oderwat.indent-rainbow).
